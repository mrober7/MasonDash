## Project Description

Our project involved the creation of a responsive web application that allows George Mason students access to important information regarding their student portfolio; this includes university requirements, schedules, courses, credits, and other details. We also created new features such as a way for students to view on the map where their classes through a more effective and user-friendly interface.
